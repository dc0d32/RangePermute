# RangePermute

Memory efficient psuedo-randomly permuted enumerator for C#/.NET to enumerate gigantic ranges.

Say you want to generate a random permutation of numbers in range [0-2^50), without duplicates. Naive approach to get decent pseudo-random permutations would need prohibitively large amount of memory.
This library can generate such enumerations using constant memory, and is suitable for Linq-style consumption.

With UInt64, currently we can support 2^64. Can easily be modified to support range up-to 2^128. Internals are 128-bit already.
